Amaze your friends by showing off your holywood hacker skills.

It's just a little wrapper script that colors "hexdump -C" output and pipes it
to "less". The higher the value the brighter the green.

Just dump the scripts in "/usr/bin" or something similar.

usage:  cx <arguments for hexdum> <filename>

or you can just pipe any space seperated hex output to hexcolors.
